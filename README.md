# Img2Txt

Img2Txt is a project to create a software to extract pieces of text from images.

The project will use Python.
At first the code will be able to read single digit(numbers), then it will also read letters and in the end it will be able to read multiple characters

I started this project to learn more and have some experience in the topic.
